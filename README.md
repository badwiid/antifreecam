# antifreecam

This plugin is a FOSS Minecraft Paper plugin for 1.21.10 that protects against players using visualization cheats
such as freecam or ESP. The plugin serves more as a technical demonstration than a production-ready solution.
It is not optimized for performance and not thoroughly tested. It can serve as a useful starting point for
other developers implementing similar protections.
